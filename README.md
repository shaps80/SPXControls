This is just a simple library providing some UI components that I sometimes use across projects.

## What's inside?

__SPXTextField__

* Includes a really simple floating labels implementation
* IBInspectable attributes for configuring your label in Interface Builder
* Seamless integration with [SPXDataValidator](https://github.com/shaps80/SPXDataValidators/)
	* If you're using `SPXData`Validators, everything will just work ;)

## Usage

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

Xcode 6 is a minimum requirement as many controls provide IBInspectable attributes.

## Installation

SPXControls is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod "SPXControls"
